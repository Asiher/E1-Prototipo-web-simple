                <p>Delta Air Lines, Inc. is a major airline in the United States headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, operating nine hubs, with Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport being its largest in terms of total passengers and number of departures. With its regional subsidiaries and contractors operating under the brand name Delta Connection, Delta has over 5,400 flights daily and serve 325 destinations in 52 countries on six continents. Delta is a founding member of the SkyTeam airline alliance which helps to extend its global network.[7] It is the oldest operating U.S. airline and the seventh-oldest operating worldwide.[8]

                    Delta ranks first in revenue and brand value among the world's largest airlines, and second by number of passengers carried, passenger miles flown, and fleet size.[9] Listed 70th on the Fortune 500 list,[10] Delta has topped The Wall Street Journal's annual rankings of airlines in 2022, 2023, and 2024 and earned first place in the 2024 Readers’ Choice Awards for Best Airlines in the U.S. by Condé Nast Traveler.[11][12]
                    
                    History
                    Main article: History of Delta Air Lines
                    Early history
                    The history of Delta Air Lines began with the world's first aerial crop dusting operation called Huff Daland Dusters, Inc. The company was founded on March 2, 1925, in Macon, Georgia, before moving to Monroe, Louisiana, in the summer of 1925.[13] It flew a Huff-Daland Duster, the first true crop duster, designed to combat the boll weevil infestation of cotton crops.[14] C.E. Woolman, general manager and later Delta's first CEO, led a group of local investors to acquire the company's assets. Delta Air Service was incorporated on December 3, 1928, and was named after the Mississippi Delta region.[15][16][17]
                    
                    Passenger operations began on June 17, 1929,[18] from Dallas, Texas, to Jackson, Mississippi, with stops at Shreveport and Monroe, Louisiana. By June 1930, service had extended east to Atlanta and west to Fort Worth, Texas.[19] Passenger service ceased in October 1930 when the airmail contract for the route Delta had pioneered was awarded to another airline, which purchased the assets of Delta Air Service. Local banker Travis Oliver, acting as a trustee, C.E. Woolman, and other local investors purchased back the crop-dusting assets of Delta Air Service and incorporated as Delta Air Corporation on December 31, 1930.[20]
                    
                    Delta Air Corporation secured an airmail contract in 1934, and began doing business as Delta Air Lines over Mail Route 24, stretching from Fort Worth, Texas, to Charleston, South Carolina.[19][21][13] Delta moved its headquarters from Monroe, Louisiana, to its current location in Atlanta in 1941.[22] The company name officially became Delta Air Lines in 1945.[23] In 1946, the company commenced regularly scheduled freight transport. In 1949, the company launched the first discounted fares between Chicago and Miami. In 1953, the company launched its first international routes after the acquisition of Chicago and Southern Air Lines.[24] In 1959, it was the first airline to fly the Douglas DC-8. In 1960, it was the first airline to fly Convair 880 jets. In 1964, it launched the Deltamatic reservation systems using computers in the IBM 7070 series. In 1965, Delta was the first airline to fly the McDonnell Douglas DC-9.
                    
                    Growth and acquisitions
                    By 1970, Delta had an all-jet fleet, and in 1972 it acquired Northeast Airlines. Trans-Atlantic service began in 1978 with the first nonstop flights from Atlanta to London. In 1981, Delta launched a frequent-flyer program. In 1987, it acquired Western Airlines, and that same year Delta began trans-Pacific service (Atlanta to Portland, Oregon, to Tokyo). In 1990, Delta was the first airline in the United States to fly McDonnell Douglas MD-11 jets. In 1991, it acquired substantially all of Pan Am's trans-Atlantic routes and the Pan Am Shuttle, rebranded as the Delta Shuttle. Delta was now the leading airline across the Atlantic.[17][25]
                    
                    In 1997, Delta was the first airline to board more than 100 million passengers in a calendar year. Also that year, Delta began an expansion of its international routes into Latin America.[26] In 2003, the company launched Song, a low-cost carrier.[17]
                    
                    Bankruptcy and restructuring (2005–2007)
                    On September 14, 2005, the company filed for bankruptcy, citing rising fuel costs.[27][28][29] It emerged from bankruptcy in April 2007 after fending off a hostile takeover from US Airways and its shares were re-listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[30][31][32]
                    
                    Acquisition of Northwest Airlines (2008–2010)
                    The acquisition of Northwest Airlines was announced on April 14, 2008. It was approved and consummated on October 29, 2008. Northwest continued to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Delta until December 31, 2009, when the Northwest Airlines operating certificate was merged into that of Delta.[33] Delta completed integration with Northwest on January 31, 2010, when their computer reservations system and websites were combined, and the Northwest Airlines brand was officially retired.[34]

                    Destinations
                    Main article: List of Delta Air Lines destinations
                    Delta and its worldwide alliance partners operate more than 15,000 flights per day.[9] Delta is the only U.S. carrier that flies to Dakar, and along with competitors United Airlines and American Airlines, are the only two U.S. carriers that fly to Stockholm and Copenhagen, respectively.[35][36]
                    
                    Hubs
                    Delta currently has nine hubs:[9][37]
                    
                    Atlanta (ATL): The airline's largest hub serving the Southern and Eastern United States and as its main gateway to Latin America and the Caribbean. Home to Delta's corporate headquarters, as well as Delta TechOps, the airline's primary maintenance base.[38]
                    Boston (BOS): Delta's secondary transatlantic hub. It offers service to destinations in Europe and North America.
                    Detroit (DTW): One of Delta's two Midwest hubs. It is the primary Asian gateway for the Eastern United States and it also provides service to many destinations in the Americas and Europe.
                    Los Angeles (LAX): Delta's secondary hub for the West Coast. It offers service to cities in Latin America, Asia, Australia, Europe, and major domestic cities and West Coast regional destinations.
                    Minneapolis/St. Paul (MSP): One of Delta's two Midwest hubs. It is the primary Canadian gateway for the airline and also serves many American metropolitan destinations, many regional destinations in the upper Midwest, and some select destinations in Europe and Asia.
                    New York–Kennedy (JFK): Delta's primary transatlantic hub. The hub also offers service on transcontinental "prestige routes" to Los Angeles and San Francisco.
                    New York–LaGuardia (LGA): Delta's second New York hub. Delta's service at LaGuardia covers numerous East Coast U.S. cities and several regional destinations in the U.S. and Canada.
                    Salt Lake City (SLC): Delta's hub for the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. Delta's service covers most major U.S. destinations and several regional destinations in the U.S., emphasizing the Rocky Mountains and select destinations in Canada and Mexico, and select cities in Europe, Hawaii and Asia.
                    Seattle/Tacoma (SEA): Delta's primary West Coast hub. The hub serves as an international gateway to Asia for the Western United States. Delta service also includes many major U.S. destinations as well as regional destinations in the Pacific Northwest.[39]
                    Delta Connection
                    This section is an excerpt from Delta Connection.[edit]

                    Wikimedia Commons has media related to DeltaConnection.
                    Delta Connection is a brand name under which Delta Air Lines has air service agreements with domestic regional air carriers that feed traffic to their network by serving passengers primarily in small and medium-sized cities in the domestic market, allowing a better match of capacity with demand in these markets. These include Endeavor Air, a wholly owned subsidiary, Republic Airways, and SkyWest Airlines. These agreements are primarily capacity purchase arrangements, where Delta controls scheduling, pricing, reservations, ticketing, and seat inventories for the flights. Delta is entitled to all ticket, cargo, mail, in-flight, and ancillary revenues from these flights, while paying the regional airlines a defined amount based on their operating costs and market rates. These capacity purchase agreements are typically long-term, often lasting at least ten years with an option to extend. Some agreements grant Delta the right to terminate or remove certain aircraft for convenience at specific future dates. Additionally, SkyWest Airlines operates some flights under a revenue proration agreement, which divides the revenue for connecting flight itineraries based on a fixed dollar or percentage division.[40]
                    Alliance and codeshare agreements
                    Delta is a member of the SkyTeam alliance and has codeshare agreements with the following airlines:[41][42]

                    Fleet
                    This section is an excerpt from Delta Air Lines fleet.[edit]

                    As of March 2025, the Delta Air Lines fleet consists of 980 mainline aircraft, making it the third largest commercial airline fleet in the world.[60][61][62] Delta Air Lines operates a fleet manufactured by Airbus and Boeing.[63]
                    
                    Delta has historically preferred purchasing or leasing used aircraft or using older-generation models to keep initial acquisition costs down. To support this business model, Delta has also invested in an extensive MRO (maintenance, repair, and overhaul) organization called TechOps. However, Delta has acquired lower-priced newer aircraft via discounts on slower-selling models as aircraft manufacturers transition to newer designs. As of December 2024, Delta's average fleet age is 14.9 years.[64]
                    
                    Before its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines, Delta's fleet was made up solely of American manufacturers' aircraft (except the Airbus A310, which was acquired from the collapsed Pan American World Airways). Aircraft from foreign manufacturers like Airbus joined the fleet after the merger with Northwest, and many more have since been added.
                    Cabin
                    Delta underwent a cabin branding upgrade in 2015.[65] Availability and exact details vary by route and aircraft type.
                    
                    Delta One
                    
                    Delta One Suite
                    Delta One is the airline's premier business class product, available on long-haul international flights, as well as transcontinental service from New York–Kennedy to Los Angeles and San Francisco.[65]
                    
                    Delta One features lie-flat seating on all aircraft types and direct aisle access from every seat on all types except the Boeing 757-200 (in which only a special sub-fleet of approximately 20 aircraft feature lie-flats) and in their 'type 35L' ex-LATAM A350s (which use a 2-2-2 layout).[66][67] The Boeing 767-300ER seats, designed by James Thompson, feature a space-saving design whereby the seats are staggered such that when in the fully flat position, the foot of each bed extends under the armrests of the seat in front of it. On the Airbus A330 cabins, Delta One features the Cirrus flat-bed sleeper suite by Zodiac Seats U.S., configured in a reverse herringbone pattern.[68]
                    
                    All seats are also equipped with a personal, on-demand in-flight-entertainment (IFE) system, universal power-ports, a movable reading light, and a folding work table. Passengers also receive meals, alcoholic beverages, an amenity kit, bedding, and pre-flight Delta Sky Club access.[69]
                    
                    In August 2016, Delta announced the introduction of Delta One Suites on select widebody fleets. The suites will feature a door to the aisle for enhanced privacy, as well as improved storage space, a larger IFE screen, and an updated design. The suites rolled out on the Airbus A350 fleet, first delivered in July 2017, followed by installation within the Boeing 777 fleet.[70][71] Delta's Airbus A330-900, which began revenue service for the airline in July 2019, also features Delta One Suites.[72] Also in July 2019, Delta began retrofitting a new seat on the 767-400ER, which featured increased privacy and design similar to Delta One Suites, though without a privacy door.[73] These seats lack a door due to the 767's smaller cabin width.
                    
                    First Class
                    
                    Delta First class on a Airbus A220
                    First Class is offered on mainline domestic flights (except those featuring Delta One service), select short- and medium-haul international flights, and Delta Connection aircraft. Seats range from 18.5 to 20.75 inches (47.0 to 52.7 cm) wide and have between 37 and 40 inches (94 and 102 cm) of pitch. Passengers in this class receive a wider variety of free snacks compared to Main Cabin, as well as free drinks and alcohol, and full meal service on flights 900 miles (1,400 km) and longer. Certain aircraft also feature power ports at each seat and free entertainment products from Delta Studio. First Class passengers are also eligible for priority boarding.[69]
                    
                    Premium Select
                    
                    Delta Premium Select on an Airbus A350-900
                    In April 2016, Delta CEO Ed Bastian announced that a new Premium Economy cabin would be added. Since renamed to Premium Select, this cabin will feature extra legroom; adjustable leg rests; extra seat pitch, width, and recline; and a new premium service. Delta introduced it on its new Airbus A350, first delivered in fall 2017, to be followed by the now-retired Boeing 777.[74] In October 2018, Delta announced that it would be selling first class seats on domestically configured Boeing 757 aircraft flying transatlantic routes as Premium Select.[75] Delta's A330-900, delivered in 2019, also offers Premium Select.[76] In 2021, Delta began retrofitting many of its 767-300ER and older A330 aircraft with Premium Select.[77]
                    
                    Delta Comfort+
                    
                    Delta Comfort+ on an Airbus A321
                    Delta Comfort+ seats are installed on all aircraft and feature 34–36 inches (860–910 mm) of pitch; on all Delta One configured aircraft, 35–36 inches (890–910 mm) of pitch and 50 percent more recline over standard Main Cabin seats.[78] Additional amenities include: priority boarding, dedicated overhead space, complimentary beer, wine, and spirits on flights 250 miles (400 km) or more, and complimentary premium snacks on flights 900 miles (1,400 km) or more. Complimentary premium entertainment is available via Delta Studio, with free headsets available on most flights.[69] On transcontinental flights between JFK-LAX/SFO, Delta Comfort+ passengers also get Luvo snack wraps. Certain Medallion members can upgrade from Main Cabin to Comfort+ for free right after booking, while other customers can upgrade for a fee or with SkyMiles.[79]
                    
                    Main Cabin
                    
                    Main Cabin on an Airbus A350-900
                    Main Cabin (Economy Class) is available on all aircraft with seats ranging from 17 to 18.6 inches (43 to 47 cm) wide and 30 to 33 inches (76 to 84 cm) of pitch. The main cabin on some aircraft has an articulating seat bottom where the seat bottom moves forward in addition to the seat back tilting backwards when reclining.[70][80]
                    
                    Main Cabin passengers receive complimentary snacks and non-alcoholic drinks on all flights 250 miles (400 km) or longer. Alcoholic beverages are also available for purchase. Complimentary meals and alcoholic drinks are provided on long-haul international flights as well as selected transcontinental domestic flights, such as between New York–JFK and Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego.[81][82] As part of Delta's Flight Fuel buy on board program, meals are available for purchase on other North American flights 900 miles (1,400 km) or longer.[81]
                    
                    Delta operated a different buy-on-board program between 2003 and 2005.[83][84] The previous program had items from differing providers, depending on the origin and destination of the flight.[85][86] Prices ranged up to $10 ($16.65 when adjusted for inflation). The airline started the service on a few selected flights in July 2003, and the meal service was initially offered on 400 flights.[87] Delta ended this buy-on-board program in 2005; instead, Delta began offering snacks at no extra charge on flights over 90 minutes to most U.S. domestic flights and some flights to the Caribbean and Latin America. Beginning in mid-March 2005 the airline planned to stop providing pillows on flights within the 48 contiguous U.S. states, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, and Central America. In addition, the airline increased the price of alcoholic beverages on Delta mainline flights from $4 ($6.44 when adjusted for inflation) to $5 ($8.05 when adjusted for inflation); the increase in alcohol prices did not occur on Song flights.[87]
                    
                    Basic Economy
                    Basic Economy is a basic version of Main Cabin, offering the same services with fewer flexibility options for a lower price.[65] Examples of fewer flexibility options include no ticket changes, no paid or complimentary upgrades regardless of frequent-flier status, and only having a seat assigned at check-in.[88] As of December 2021, Basic Economy travelers no longer earn award miles (used for redeeming free travel, for example) or medallion qualifying miles (which count towards elite status).[89]
                    
                    Reward programs
                    SkyMiles
                    Main article: SkyMiles
                    SkyMiles is the frequent flyer program for Delta Air Lines. Miles do not expire but accounts may be deactivated by Delta in certain cases, such as the death of a program member or fraudulent activity.[90]
                    
                    Delta Sky Club
                    
                    A Sky Club in Concourse B at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport
                    Delta Sky Club is the branding name of Delta's airport lounges. Membership is available through an annual membership that can be purchased with either money or miles. International passengers travelling in Delta One class get free access. Membership can also be granted through top-level Delta status or by being an American Express cardholder with certain exceptions. As of January 2019, Delta no longer offered single-day passes.[91]
                    
                    Originally, Delta's membership-based airport clubs were called Crown Room lounges, with Northwest's called WorldClubs.
                    
                    Exclusive Delta One Clubs for customers travelling in business class are slated to open at New York–Kennedy, Los Angeles, and Boston in 2024.[92][93]
                    
                    In February 2024, Delta announced a new, more exclusive or premium level of Sky Club lounge aimed at high-spending travellers. The first would be at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, followed by those in Boston's Logan International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport later in the year. In addition to wellness areas, the lounge would offer a full-service brasserie and a marketplace influenced or assisted by a chef that would feature an open kitchen. The move represented a shift away from a standard offering to something closer to a unique experience for each airport and the city in which the lounge was located.[94][95][96]

                    On November 27, 2001, Delta Air Lines launched SkyBonus,[97] a program aimed toward small-to-medium businesses spending between $5,000 and $500,000 annually on air travel.[98] Businesses can earn points toward free travel and upgrades, as well as Sky Club memberships and SkyMiles Silver Medallion status. Points are earned on paid travel based on various fare amounts paid, booking codes, and place origin or destination.[99] While enrolled businesses are able to earn points toward free travel, the travelling passenger is still eligible to earn SkyMiles during his or her travel.[99]
                    
                    In early 2010, Delta Air Lines merged its SkyBonus program with Northwest's similar Biz Perks program.[99]</p>
